# Wepify

**Wepify** is a modern website builder that lets you easily create responsive websites. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **styled-components**, it provides a smooth, interactive experience for designing web pages directly in the browser.

**NOTE:** In development mode, the app may feel a bit slow, and some components **can feel like they are rendered multiple times during interactions**. This is normal and not a bug â€” React and Vite can do this for optimization and to ensure everything works correctly. **In production, these issues do not occur and the app runs smoothly.**
